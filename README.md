Freshbooks.js is a node.js module providing a wrapper to the [FreshBooks]
(http://www.freshbooks.com) API.

All API method are fairly well documented at [FreshBooks Developers]
(http://developers.freshbooks.com) but if you find a discrepancy between the
docs and this wrapper feel free to file an "Issue".

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install --save @leonardodino/freshbooks
```

or

```shell
$ yarn add @leonardodino/freshbooks
```

Note: This module utilises [libxmljs](https://github.com/polotek/libxmljs). You
will need have the **libxml2** library installed and also the **libxml2-devel**
(**libxml2-dev** on debian systems) package. This comes with the `xml2-config`
utility that is needed for compiling.  **This command must be in your path.**

## Example
```javascript
const FreshBooks = require('freshbooks')
const freshbooks = new FreshBooks(api_url, api_token)
const invoice = new freshbooks.Invoice()

invoice.get(invoice_id, function(err, invoice){
  if(err){
    //returns if an error has occured, ie invoice_id doesn't exist.
    return console.log(err)
  }
  console.log(`Invoice Number: ${invoice.number}`)
})
```
## Changelog

**v2.0.0 - 2016-09-03**

- Fixed an issue with the `Content-Length` header not respecting multi-byte strings encoded with UTF-8 [#2](/../../issues/2)

_Note: this may break existing code that works around this, hence the major bump to v2.0.0. Most implementations will be able to upgrade to v2.0.0 without any issues._

**Update 2016-05-31:** Added support for node v5 and v6. Updated libxmljs to 0.18.0. Bumped the version to 1.0.1.

**Update 05/10/2015:** Project maintenance taken over by Flow XO. Fixed issue with Invoice lines. Created `invoice.lines.add` function. Added support for node v4. Updated libxmljs to 0.14.3. Bumped the version to 1.0.0.

Note: this is a backwards-compatible release. If you were previously using v0.2.1, you should be safe to upgrade to v1.0.0.

**Update 24/08/2013:** Bumped the version to 0.2.1. Fixed a bug preventing invoice lines from being created/updated. Updated libxmljs to 0.8.1. Fixed Projects and Category tests from failing.

**Update 17/10/2012:** ...and version 0.2.0 has landed! We are now using the latest
version of libxmljs (currently version 0.6.1). We have also added an "options"
object to contain invoice_id, subject and message to
[Estimate,Invoice].sendByEmail, allowing for custom email messages.

**Update 18/08/2012:** Version 0.1.2 has just been pushed. There is now an "options"
object containing page, per_page, pages and total accessible from list methods.

**Update 14/07/2012:** Just entered version 0.1.1! Most methods now accept an optional
id first argument (similar to how invoice.get() works). Examples have been
updated *and* all tests are passing.

**Update 08/07/2012:** We've just entered version 0.1.0! All required API features are
now implemented excluding callback and system.

**Update 05/06/2012:** I've implimented about 75% of the API. Most of the core features
are working but i'm still working through some minor issues. Tests are working
now though!

**Update 04/06/2012:** This project is very much a *WORK IN PROGRESS*. So far I've
implimented the majority of the Invoice API and am tidying up the code before
launching into the other APIs. I've also decided
to take some liberties on some aspects of the API, ie replacing
invoice.lines.add/delete/update methods with Array.pop/push, as frankly there
are better ways to interact with the API in JS than is currently implimented.

## Credits
